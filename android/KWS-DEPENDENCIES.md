# Offline keyword engine dependency and model provenance

Build21 includes an opt-in foreground-service Hey Sarah listener, backed by `HeySarahKeywordEngine`. It requires microphone permission, user opt-in, a visible notification, and explicit Stop; no boot-autostart claim. Acoustic reliability and battery behavior are not established by this source publication.

## Code
- Official sherpa-onnx **v2.0.1**, Apache-2.0: https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx/blob/v2.0.1/LICENSE
- Official AAR: https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx/releases/download/v2.0.1/sherpa-onnx-2.0.1.aar
- SHA256 **a8d09d1d32f3eb8520482c6d3d43fae674681c5b050385967c70a3c2c9bf0ee7**, verified against GitHub API asset digest. This compiled AAR is excluded from Git; fetch official bytes separately to `app/libs/sherpa-onnx-2.0.1.aar` and verify hash before building.
- ABI filter: arm64-v8a + x86_64. Both contain libonnxruntime, sherpa C/C++ API and JNI libraries. No claim physical ARM64 execution.
- Upstream v2.0.1 Android runtime CMake pins ONNX Runtime **1.28.2**: https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx/blob/v2.0.1/cmake/onnxruntime-android-aarch64.cmake
- ONNX Runtime MIT license and third-party notices from microsoft/onnxruntime **v1.28.2**, retained in APK assets/licenses along with engine Apache-2.0 license. Existing provisional 1.23.2 texts were replaced before final build.

## Model
- Official mobile artifact: https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx/releases/download/kws-models/sherpa-onnx-kws-zipformer-gigaspeech-3.3M-2024-01-01-mobile.tar.bz2
- Archive SHA256 **2e6ac2577310bfa2f4b6b5fab0478b868c9d0b2cb2c51b3e13b50581b588864d** (verify inventory).
- Model-specific README shipped inside official archive explicitly declares `license: Apache License 2.0`; it names author's repository https://www.modelscope.cn/pkufool/sherpa-onnx-kws-zipformer-gigaspeech-3.3M-2024-01-01.git. Upstream Kotlin API also points to this author's exact model. README preserved byte-for-byte in assets/kws; notes.md records SARAH's original-encoder selection; this is separate evidence from code license.
- Final selected archive: https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx/releases/download/kws-models/sherpa-onnx-kws-zipformer-gigaspeech-3.3M-2024-01-01.tar.bz2
- Original archive SHA256 **f170013b4716e41b62b9bfd809687c207cef798ef9bc6534d524e17af9b6561a**. Original README also explicitly declares Apache License 2.0. The mobile-converted encoder failed ONNX Reshape in real inference; replaced with original dynamic-batch int8 encoder. Decoder/joiner/tokens/BPE checked byte-identical between archives.
- GigaSpeech XL-trained 3.3M English model. Bundled original int8 encoder/joiner, float decoder, tokens.txt, bpe.model. No training audio/test_wavs bundled in production.
- HEY SARAH encoded with actual supplied SentencePiece bpe.model: `▁HE Y ▁SA RA H @HEY_SARAH`. Every token validated in supplied tokens.txt. Underscore is result alias only, not spoken phrase. Space in result alias fails sherpa keyword parser; discovered and corrected by real native inference.

## Verification boundary
The local development report records code21 synthetic emulator service/Stop proof, prior unit suite/lint/build, and subsequent user phone acceptance. These do not prove acoustic wake reliability, all call/permission/role-loss cases, battery endurance, or fresh build equivalence. Never upload ambient audio or retain household PCM.
